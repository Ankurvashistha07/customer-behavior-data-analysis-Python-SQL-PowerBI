### The process includes:

• Loading and analyzing data using Python
• Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Cleaning and transforming data
• Running SQL queries using relational databases
• Building an interactive dashboard in Power BI
• Creating a structured analytical report
• Designing a professional presentation using Gamma
• The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills, strong problem-solving ability, and business-focused storytelling.

## Dataset

• Source: Structured business dataset (CSV format)
• Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analytics
• Data type: Transactional / Operational business data

### Key fields include:

• Product details
• Sales / Revenue metrics
• Dates and categories
• The dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
• Programming & Analysis
• Python
• Pandas
• NumPy
• Matplotlib / Seaborn
• Database Systems
• PostgreSQL
• MySQL
• Microsoft SQL Server
• Business Intelligence
• Microsoft Power BI
• Presentation & Reporting
• Gamma

## Project Workflow (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1: Data Loading (Python)

• Imported dataset using Pandas
• Checked structure, datatypes, and summary statistics
• Identified missing values and inconsistencies

#### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Analyzed distributions and trends
• Identified outliers
• Created visualizations (bar charts, line plots, correlation heatmaps)
• Generated business-level insights

#### Step 3: Data Cleaning

• Handled missing values
• Removed duplicates
• Standardized column formats
• Converted data types
• Created derived metrics (KPIs)

#### Step 4: SQL Analysis

• Data was loaded into relational databases and queried using:
• Joins
• Group By & Aggregations
• Window Functions
• Subqueries
• Performance optimization techniques (indexes where required)
• Business questions answered via SQL:
• Top-performing products
• Monthly revenue trends
• Customer segmentation
• Regional performance analysis

#### Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

• An interactive dashboard was built to visualize:
• Revenue trends over time
• Sales by category and region
• Customer insights
• KPI summary cards
• Drill-through analysis
• The dashboard enables business stakeholders to quickly understand performance and trends.

## Dashboard Features

• Clean, recruiter-friendly design
• Interactive filters (Date, Region, Category)
• Dynamic KPI calculations
• Visual storytelling
• Business-focused layout

## Results & Insights

• Key outcomes of the analysis:
• Identified top revenue-generating products
• Discovered seasonal sales patterns
• Highlighted underperforming segments
• Found opportunities for customer retention improvement
• Improved data consistency through structured cleaning
• This project demonstrates the ability to turn raw data into meaningful business decisions.

## Report & Presentation

• A structured analytical report summarizing findings
• Visual dashboard screenshots included
• Executive-level PowerPoint presentation created using Gamma
• Clear problem → analysis → insight → recommendation flow
